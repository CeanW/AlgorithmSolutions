# AlgorithmSolutions

This is a repo that I practice algorithm and data structure.  
Most of the problems are from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/ctdr/).  
Java is the programming language I am most familiar with. Thus, most of the solutions are implemented by Java.  
Well, I always think I am a newbie in programming.  
Discussion is welcomed all the time!  
No perfect solution.  
:D
